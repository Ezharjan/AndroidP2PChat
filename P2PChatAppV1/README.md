# P2P Chat

This is an Android Application that we created in the class "Distributed Systems".
Our goal is to exploit the opportunities modern mobile devices and operating systems provide, to create a 
messaging app that works without network access. The app sets up a fully oï¬„ine peer-to-peer connection 
between two or more devices, using the Wi-Fi P2P capabilities provided by Android phones.
